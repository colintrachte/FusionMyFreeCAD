# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes to FusionMyFreeCAD are recorded here.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-08-31

### Ribbon access and personalization

- Added a complete dropdown menu to every FusionMyFreeCAD panel, keeping commands accessible even
  when they are not pinned to the ribbon face.
- Added direct click-hold-drag reordering for visible ribbon icons without a separate arrangement
  mode. Ordinary clicks continue to run commands using Qt's normal drag threshold.
- Persisted panel and command order across FreeCAD restarts and FusionMyFreeCAD layout updates.
- Added **Reset this panel** to each panel menu. It restores only that panel; **Reapply UI** remains
  the deliberate whole-interface reset.
- Expanded the Part Design, Part, and Sketcher command inventories so less-frequent native tools are
  no longer buried.

### Installation, recovery, and settings

- Replaced the retired Windows-specific installer with one self-contained FreeCAD add-on archive
  for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Added an immutable first-run baseline, **Verify UI**, **Reapply UI**, and **Restore UI** workflows.
- Added a standalone recovery macro for restoring the previous UI after the add-on was removed.
- Added FusionMyFreeCAD preferences for the startup workbench, navigation, shortcuts, and optional
  starter design.
- Preserved user preference changes after initial setup by applying defaults only once per release.

### Reliability and packaging

- Bundled the Ribbon and SearchBar runtimes without external Python dependencies or startup dialogs.
- Curated all 153 layout icons directly from FreeCAD's official source and recorded their source
  paths and SHA-256 hashes.
- Added cross-platform CI, behavioral installation/recovery tests, archive validation, formatting,
  linting, and package-hygiene checks.
- Added adaptive FREQUENT panels and improved reporting for displaced keyboard shortcuts and runtime
  failures.

### Upgrade notes

- Replace the entire existing `Mod/FusionMyFreeCAD` folder; do not merge files from older versions.
- Existing add-on-based panel arrangements are retained and reconciled with the 1.2.0 layout.
- Users of the retired installer should remove its obsolete copy after installing the release
  archive in FreeCAD's active user `Mod` directory.

## 0.1 — 2026-08-01

- Published the first functional prototype and initial Fusion-style layout.
